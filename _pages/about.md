📖 I am an incoming Ph.D. student in the [EECS department](https://engineering.uci.edu/dept/eecs) in University of California, Irvine, where I will be working with Prof. [Aparna](https://hpcforge.eng.uci.edu/) in [HPC Forge](https://hpcforge.eng.uci.edu/).

🎓 Prior to graduate school, I received my B.S in Mathematics at National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, where I was advised by Prof. [Che-Rung Lee](https://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~cherung/) for my undergraduate study.

🔬 My research interests include: 
- Computational Science
- Machine Learning
- High-Performance Computing
- AI for Science.

Besides academic, I love to watch and play basketball in my free time 🏀
