I'm an incoming Ph.D. student at University of California, Irvine supervised by Prof. Aparna at [this lab](https://hpcforge.eng.uci.edu/).

Prior to graduate school, I acquired my B.S at National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

My research interests are in Computational Science and Machine Learning and my future research focus will be on High-Performance Computing techniques on Science for AI.
